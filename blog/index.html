<p>A great documentary about climate change:<br>Degrees of Uncertainty by Neil Halloran.</p>

<p>Our society functions<br>thanks to specialized occupations.<br>— Neil Halloran</p>
<p>Defeatist might take comfort in inevitability<br>the way denialist take comfort in uncertainty.<br>It takes the pressure off.<br>— Neil Halloran</p>
<p>To devise and then rally behind a good plan,<br>we first have to believe<br>that our future is uncertain,<br>because only then might we be so bold<br>as to shape it.<br>— Neil Halloran</p>
<p>Another amazing documentary by Neil Halloran,<br>called the Fallen of World War II:</p>

<p>Most deaths in World War II were civilian deaths, not military. That's interesting, and sad. I never knew that.</p>

<p>Maybe Japan's cruelty during World War II was a response to Nazi Germany, because the Japanese leaders realized that the Nazis would probably come for them next, and if they weren't a sizable power by then, they'd be defeated and captured. Just a thought. I'm no expert.</p>

<p>The world population was less than 3 billion in 1959! Wow. Now it's nearly 8 billion.</p>

<p>This guy Neil doesn't miss:</p>

<p>Human-beings have really abandoned God, eh?</p>

<p>There's no simple answer for achieving peace, but there is a simple hope: If we're clever enough to design such sophisticated weapons, we might also be clever enough to ensure we never use them. Our weapons are undeniably powerful. They dazzle us, and remind us of our human potential. Instruments for preventing war are usually mundane; and if powerful, tend to go unnoticed. If they prevented a catastrophe, we'd probably never know it. And that's what makes it so hard to prove what works in preventing war.<br>— Neil Halloran</p>

<p>The United Nations actually hires professional peacekeepers? That's pretty bomb. (No pun intended. Or is that an anti-pun?)</p>

<p>A well-made recap of the Ukraine situation by Vox:</p>

<p>These war-men need a little more faith in their lives.<br>A little more God.</p>

<hr>

<p>Starting something new is always a strange feeling. There's a sensation of emptiness. Nothing has come before. It's daunting. There's nothing familiar to hang your hat on. It's just... blank. It's liberating, in a way. But also... daunting. Well, hello. Welcome! This is the first post on this blog, and today (2 March 2022) is my 26th birthday. 26-years-old today. 26 years? That's all? Feels like a lot longer. Well, anyways, welcome. This blog is gonna be a jack-of-all-trades type blog. Lots of different stuff. Just stuff I find interesting or informative, exciting and useful. This blog will act as a platform for connection and expression; not just for me but for anyone else who engages here. And I hope (and plan) to grow this website, this platform, into something big and beautiful. But it will take time, and patience. And I have to start somewhere. And starting something new is always strange.</p>

<p>I'll go into more detail about me and who I am in the near-future; but for now I'll just share that it's my birthday, and I'm currently staying at an AirBnb in Jacksonville, an American city in the northeast of Florida. The color-theme of my AirBnB is salmon and mustard. A pretty interesting and unique combo. It looks better than it sounds, trust me. The AirBnB is nice. There's a private bathroom, a giant smart-TV, a mini-fridge, and a work-desk area. The hosts are super nice and friendly. Jacksonville is a pretty cool city. This is my first time here. I don't have anything planned for my birthday. I'm not really a "birthday" person. To me, it's just another day. Another beautiful day. Because everyday is beautiful. Sure, some days are harder than others. Sometimes life can get <em>really</em> hard. But there's still beauty in the struggle, I think. It can be harder to see the beauty <em>when</em> you're struggling. But it's there, if you look closely. That's what I've found, at least.</p>

<p>So, yeah. I'm just here visiting Jacksonville. Sort of a random trip, a random place to be. But I guess everywhere is random, in a way. Every moment can feel random, arbitrary. Sometimes I wonder about the details of our lives. Everything feels so specific: Being a particular species (human), being part of a particular family, living in a particular city or town, in a particular country, on a particular planet. Everything feels so specific, so random, so arbitrary. "The devil's in the details," they say.</p>

<p>Well, anyways. I might go to St. Augustine today. I haven't yet decided what I plan on doing today. St. Augustine is one of the oldest cities in America. Pretty cool. I've heard good things about it. I'll share some pictures of it here, when I visit. Actually, that's something I'll be sharing a lot on this blog: Travel. I travel a lot. It's one of the funnest ways to spend time, to spend life, in my experience. So come along on the journey with me! 🙂</p>

<p>In the meantime, here are some quotes I read or heard recently, which I thought were interesting, and thus documented:</p>

<p>
    When everyone can play,<br>
the game gets better.<br>
— Mellody Hobson
</p>

<p>The same bone that you pick will break.<br>—Mac Miller</p>

<p>Y'all know this is just my opinion, right?<br>— Anthony Fantano</p>

<p>Every child is an artist.<br>The problem is how to remain an artist as we grow up.<br>— Pablo Picasso</p>

<p>
    Nothing in fashion can be luxurious<br>
if it's doing harm to the environment.<br>
— Anya Hindmarch
</p>

<p>Maybe we, as a society,<br>should take a step back,<br>and re-examine just exactly <em>what</em><br>is truly important.<br>Is mass-production of unnecessary products<br><em>really</em> necessary, when our environment<br>is slowly being destroyed<br>by industrial production?</p>

<p>Space is humanity's great taunting. It taunts us because it's always there, it's always visible; directly across the cosmic window, just on the other side of the glass, this great expanse we can see and imagine, but cannot touch; and that lure is irresistible.<br>— Jeffrey Kluger (Countdown: Inspiration4)</p>

<p>Wherever you are in life,<br>you've gotta go.<br>
    — Jerry Seinfeld</p>

<p>Just let the past be the past.<br>— Jaden (SYRE Electric)</p>

<p>The best things in life<br>are on the other side of fear.<br>How we decide to confront our fears,<br>that is the person we become.<br>I decided to be funny.<br>— Will Smith</p>
<p>Impermanence is a law of the universe.<br>You&#39;re gonna change.<br>— Will Smith</p>
<p>Out-create the cycle of destruction.<br>— Will Smith</p>
<p>There&#39;s nothing I&#39;ve ever experienced<br>like changing your body<br>that teaches the rules of the universe.<br>Transforming and cultivating<br>a healthy body and a healthy mind<br>is really similar to the macro-process<br>of cultivating a better world.<br>— Will Smith</p>

<p>It&#39;s all family.<br>— Gstaad Guy</p>

<p>Once you start a blog,<br>your entire worldview becomes blogs.<br>— Tim Urban</p>

<p>Taking friction out of processes<br>has been the playbook of Silicon Valley<br>for the last decade or two.<br>
    — Jason Calacanis</p>

<p>
    You become like the people<br>you surround yourself with.<br>— Mark Zuckerberg (Lex Fridman Podcast)
</p>

<p>This is a pretty cliche statement by Mark, but it's nevertheless very true. And it's important to remind ourselves of this truth often, and wake up to its reality. Stay vigilant, that you're not getting in with the wrong crowd. A lot of people try to fix others by staying around them rather than fixing themselves by leaving. Lead by example. And sometimes leading by example means moving away from someone or some group of people. And maybe, when they're ready, they'll come find you, as improved versions of themselves.</p>

<p>Our platforms should be designed around people interacting with each other, and that&#39;s not how phones are designed today; they&#39;re designed around apps.<br>— Mark Zuckerberg<br>(Sure, but many of our apps exist for the very purpose of people interacting with each other... Not sure this is a valid criticism of Apple and Android. He does however go on to say that apps often aren&#39;t compatible with each other, and I agree with this. It would be nice, for example, to be able to link my Twitter and my Instagram networks; but because they are competitors, they&#39;re not compatible. This does seem to be changing slowly though, as apps become more compatible with each other. But this could also increase centralization and monopoly; something Mark knows all too well.)</p>

<p>If you don't know what you're looking for<br>you'll never find it.<br>— Scott Dinsmore</p>

<p>RIP Scott Dinsmore. Damn. Life is so crazy. Death is so crazy. One minute you're living your best life, the next minute you're being crushed by a boulder. Jesus. The universe is a wild place.</p>

<p>
    My handiwork of deception<br>
    is woven into the fabric of the universe.<br>
— Loki (The Simpsons)
</p>

<p>
Seeing all that horror and poverty makes me think<br>
we should lower the corporate tax-rate even further!<br>
— Montgomery Burns
</p>

<p>I love humanity.<br>— Elon Musk (Lex Fridman Podcast)</p>

<p>
There's no instruction manual<br>
for rebuilding society.<br>
— Charles Hoskinson
</p>

<p>
We have to do things differently.<br>
The wars aren't going to stop.<br>
They're going to get worse.<br>
Inflation is not going to stop.<br>
It's going to get worse.<br>
The world isn't going to magically wake up tomorrow<br>
and get better.<br>
The default mode is to get worse.<br>
The only way it gets better<br>
is if we collectively decide<br>
we've had enough,<br>
and it has to get better,<br>
so we do the work to get there.<br>
— Charles Hoskinson

When you give freedom and liberty to all,<br>
you take authority and power from the kings.<br>

<p>WARNING: This blog is super random. 😁</p>

<p>Here are some things I wrote in my notes recently:</p>

<p>Things are not<br>inherently good<br>or inherently bad.<br>Things just are<br>what they are.</p>

<p>Language is code.<br>Code is language.</p>

<p>How does one respond<br>to the ineffably infinite nature<br>of reality and existence?</p>
<p>Express what you are inspired<br>to communicate with others.<br>The more honest you are with yourself,<br>the more powerful your art will be.<br>— Masako Saeki (Blue Period)</p>
<p>Admitting you like something is scary.<br>I don&#39;t know why.<br>— Yatora (Blue Period)</p>
<p>The fire of knowledge.<br>An eternal flame.<br>Use yours to light others.</p>
<p>Intelligence is often fleet.</p>
<p>Consider how much waste you produce.</p>
<p>It&#39;s okay to start small.<br>Indeed, cherish the small start.<br>Because when things get bigger,<br>things will get more complex.<br>And then there&#39;s no turning back.<br>You&#39;ve started small,<br>but become big.<br>You&#39;ve made it.<br>You&#39;re here.<br>But now you&#39;ll long for the days<br>when you were just starting,<br>when things were small.</p>
<p>We are now gods<br>but for the wisdom.<br>— Eric Weinstein</p>
<p>We need to spread out.<br>— Eric Weinstein</p>
<p>Let&#39;s send some people to the Moon.</p>
<p>I remember, back in 2018, some dude, one of my cousin&#39;s friends, told me that we should take all the homeless people out into the desert and kill them. I was in the middle of a 6-hour road-trip with him, and I didn&#39;t wanna stir the pot too hot, so I repressed my shock at his violent proposal and just kinda shrugged it off. But internally I was thinking: &quot;What the fuck...&quot; 😂 🤦</p>
<p>According to chemistry,<br>most of reality is empty space,<br>since 99.9% of each atom<br>is just that.</p>
<p>The military lifestyle<br>is appealing to some<br>because it provides<br>safety,<br>security,<br>comradery,<br>discipline,<br>thrill,<br>and more.</p>
<p>Time<br>is just another word<br>for change.</p>
<p>It&#39;s becoming clear<br>that I haven’t been taking<br>full advantage of the fact,<br>the privilege,<br>that I have<br>almost constant access<br>to beautifully designed computers<br>and high-speed internet.<br>And it&#39;s also becoming clear,<br>the older I get,<br>that a big part of youth,<br>and a big part of maturing,<br>is realizing the things<br>we take for granted,<br>the things we ought<br>to appreciate more,<br>to be more grateful for.</p>
<p>God is always watching you.</p>
<p>I’ve existed for awhile now.<br>And the only way to prove it<br>is with data.</p>
<p>All rules are man-made.<br>In the world of man, at least.</p>
<p>There are beautiful people everywhere.</p>
<p>It seems that our bodies achieve an ideal state<br>when they are pushed toward the limits of survival.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not hiding anymore.</p>

<p>The universe has to be infinite.<br>It couldn't be any other way.<br>It's an exquisitely tragic miracle.</p>

<p>Embrace the messiness.<br>There's no way to stop it.<br>Infinity just unravels and unravels...<br>Chaos, chaos, chaos...<br>Entropy. Oh, entropy.<br>There's no stopping it.<br>Embrace the mess.</p>

<p>The moral of the story.</p>

<p>Evil,<br>in any capacity,<br>to any extent,<br>is not okay.<br>What is evil?<br>You know in your heart.</p>

<p>My singular vision of the world...<br>Impossibly inescapable.</p>

<p>Expel weakness.<br>Overcome fear.</p>

<p>
Money is a form of potential energy.<br>
Production is a form of kinetic energy.<br>
Wealth is the combination of both.
</p>

<p>Meta-perception:<br>To perceive the perceiver.</p>

<p>Positive and negative.<br>Duality.</p>

<p>
Every face I talk to...<br>
is you.<br>
watching over me.
</p>

<p>Give me reasons to believe.</p>

<p>I didn't create any of this...<br>yet somehow I'm here.</p>

<p>Imagine being a true explorer,<br>
    back in the day.<br>
    Wow.<br>
    What a sight to behold.</p>


<p>Step into the light.<br>Let the light into your eyes.</p>

<p>I salute you.</p>

<p>Air it out.</p>

<p>Right your wrongs.<br>Trust me, it’s good for you.</p>

<p>Your zen moment.<br>It was all meant to be.</p>

<p>What you achieve in a dishonest way<br>will be painfully taken away from you.<br>Achievement via dishonesty is not worthwhile.</p>

<p>Forgive,<br>but don’t forget.</p>

<p>Security.<br>
    How secure can we be?<br>
    100% security is not possible, it seems.<br>
    So how much attention to security should we give?<br>
    And how much should we simply rely on faith?<br>
    On the goodness of people?<br>
    On their kind nature?<br>
    On the hope that they won't hack us?</p>

<p>Wholesome energy is beautiful.</p>

<p>Reality is a puzzle. Science is an attempt to solve it.</p>

<p>It’s not even about you.<br>And yet, it's all about you.</p>

<p>How ought one spend their time?<br>Is there a formula?</p>

<p>Is it possible to be 100% honest?<br>And is it even intelligent to try to be 100% honest?</p>

<p>Leave our kids alone.</p>

<p>What is worth working on?</p>

<p>Legal scholars<br>must have a sharp distinguishing literary eye.</p>

<p>
I am an ally of the cause.<br>
Protector of the allegiance.<br>
Steward of the land.<br>
Friend to all agents in the field.
</p>

<p>
Trust is the key element<br>
which gets you to high places.
</p>

<p>
Folks look at me like I’m a mystery to them.<br>
I guess it makes sense.<br>
I’m a mystery to myself, honestly.<br>
Indeed, everything is mysterious,<br>
in one way or another.
</p>

<p>Civilization is a zoo.</p>

<p>
Flex your core often for strong abs.<br>
And get lots of cardio exercise.<br>
Walk. Hike. Run. Bike. Swim.<br>
Anything. Whatever.<br>
Just get lots of cardio.<br>
And often activate your core.
</p>

<p>Don't force it.<br>Good or bad,<br>don't force it.</p>

<p>Money can buy belief, it seems.</p>

<p>If it’s working,<br>don’t mess with it.</p>

<p>In the end, love is a choice.</p>

<p>The other day, I saw a sign which read:<br>"No inflation here!<br>Same low prices!"<br>😂</p>

<p>Godly troubles are not so interesting to God,<br>
    for they can be solved with the snap of a finger.<br>
    No. Human troubles are far more interesting to God.<br>
    Troubles which are true puzzles,<br>
    which cannot be solved with magic.<br>
    Troubles that burn and burrow,<br>
    for years, decades, generations, millenia.</p>

<p>The only way to truly toughen up<br>
        is to expose yourself to the wilderness of nature.<br>
        There is no “simulation” for toughening up.<br>
        And you will get hurt.<br>
        And you will learn to overcome.
</p>

<p>Examine yourself closely.</p>

<p>For the world to wake up,<br>you must wake up,<br>and then you must wake up the world.</p>

<p>Sometimes things look good on the outside,<br>but aren’t so great on the inside.<br>For example:<br>A lot of beautiful people have sexual diseases.</p>

<p>Does every being in the universe suffer?<br>Does every being in the universe sometimes experience pain?</p>

<p>Be useful.</p>

<p>Set intentions.</p>

<p>Live with a military mindset.</p>

<p>Put it on a t-shirt, bruh.</p>

<p>But where is the data being stored?</p>

<p>Genetics is the name of the game.<br>Survival.<br>More life.</p>
<p>Tell your stories as if they are real<br>because, when you write them, they are.<br>(To the level of your expertise.)</p>
<p>Be decisive.<br>Even about your indecisiveness.<br>The more decisive you are<br>the less they&#39;ll be able to predict<br>your next move.<br>But remember:<br>It&#39;s all a paradox.</p>
<p>Get feedback;<br>constant feedback.<br>Feedback is rebound;<br>rebound is resound;<br>and resound is resonation:<br>To sound again.<br>Vibratory reiteration.</p>
<p>I&#39;m playing the game against myself.</p>
<p>Ask: &quot;What&#39;s exciting?&quot;<br>Then express that.<br>Like when Savin stumbles<br>upon some ruins.<br>The mystery of ruins:<br>Who was here before?</p>
<p>Thoughts:<br>Just a thought.</p>
<p>Everyone is a potential patron.</p>
<p>Nowadays, it feels like<br>no one has the time<br>if you don&#39;t have the money.</p>
<p>Some days I feel like I have to relax more.<br>Some days I feel like I have to work harder.<br>On which days am I correct?<br>Or is it just a balance?<br>Always, a balance...</p>
<p>Just figuring things out.<br>Figuring things out out-loud.<br>Thinking out-loud.</p>
<p>Stronger together.</p>
<p>If you were perfect from the beginning,<br>then life wouldn&#39;t be a journey.</p>
<p>I&#39;m gonna redefine the hashtag<br>#Oversharing.</p>
<p>Others will treat you<br>however you treat yourself.<br>And how you treat yourself<br>is how you treat others.<br>So act from a place of love<br>and you will be loved.</p>
<p>I&#39;m just trying to develop a holistic understanding
of our world and our society.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not really about money.<br>It&#39;s about who&#39;s really doing the work<br>to ensure our survival and our thrival.<br>Who is truly creating our prosperity?<br>Those are the people who reap most rewards;<br>the greatest rewards in life. </p>

<p>Last night I watched the latest Simpsons episode. Season 33 Episode 12. It's really good. It's about romance and old age and survival. The Simpsons team just keeps on killin' it. What an amazing TV series.</p>

<p>An AirBnB I stayed at recently was called Your Zen Moment. A very appropriate name for me.</p>

<p>Ah, CollegeHumor... Jake and Amir... This is classic:</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ovw0Wo5Hdck" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Lately I've been thinking about doing something politically-related with my time. Either as a global political commentator (basically just someone who publicly shares their political thoughts online) or as a local political actor (basically just someone who gets involved in local politics). I want to start engaging in more "meaningful" work. I've been traveling the world since college, doing odd jobs here and there; which has been very fun and eye-opening, but that lifestyle isn't as productive as I'd like to be now. I want to really start contributing to society in a more direct, more substantial way; rather than just going on my own personal adventures and doing the work I gotta do to pay my bills. Being a hippie nomad is fun, but it's too self-contained. It's not broad enough. As I've grown older and matured, I've realized the power of institutions, of really building a foundation, rather than just willy-nilly contribution here and there. The value of structure, of order. These things provide clarity; clarity of purpose, clarity of action. I hope to build XY4 into an institution.</p>

<p>But, yeah: Politics. Politics is a very direct way to influence people's lives, in a (hopefully) positive way. It impacts real day-to-day things that are happening in people's lives. But if you go into politics, do you have to pick a side? I don't want to alienate people by "picking a side". I suppose, at a certain point, you must; because you must stand for what you believe, and what you believe might disagree with certain groups of people. It's important to express your opinion, but to also do it in a polite manner. Spark and inspire peaceful civil discourse. Speak intelligently and calmly, not rashly and angrily. Express your political philosophy in a loving way. My political philosophy is to express my political philosophy kindly and calmly.</p>

<p>What&#39;s my goal? Elon Musk&#39;s goal is to send humans to Mars, and move the automobile industry into cleaner forms of energy, and increase human intelligence by connecting our brains to the internet, and solving traffic in metropoli. Pretty ambitious dude. He has really set his sights high, really given himself a greater purpose to live for. Seems like a decent way to live. So what is my goal? What&#39;s a high and mighty vision which I can wake up and strive for everyday?</p>

<p>Here's a <a href="+/wma.html" target="_blank">random graphic</a> I made of my face, if you wanna look at my face. 😂 I look so serious in this photo. But I do feel like it's one of the better photos of me, because it looks somewhat professional, and the colors are quaint and antique. It makes me look like a smart handsome young man (which is what I am, hopefully). I'm trying to emphasize "professionalism" in my life lately, because I've been so far-out of a hippie for so many years, that I think it's time I become a bit more "buttoned-up", especially since I'm looking to start a new career soon. Maybe I'll run for president one day. (LOL.)</p>

<p>I'm back from St. Augustine. It's a pretty cool city. Good vibes. I went to a restaurant and bar called Ice Plant. Very cool atmosphere, full of interesting youthful people with nice swagger. Now I'm watching a Netflix documentary series called The Family. It's about a secretive political organization. "Secretive" doesn't necessarily mean "bad" though. It's complicated. I'm actually not sure that I agree with the messaging of the documentary, with the side it seems to take. But like I said, it's complicated, and I don't have all the information, because I'm not an expert on this stuff. But it's an interesting documentary, nevertheless.</p>

<p>Rings of power.<br>A new religion.</p>
<p>What&#39;s visible is transitory.<br>What&#39;s invisible is permanent.</p>
<p>Write what you wish,<br>and it will become so.</p>
<p>The real power is in the small groups.<br>We are all students of power.</p>
<p>No man, no nation, can grow<br>without divine guidance.</p>
<p>God governs in the affairs of men.</p>
<p>The right man<br>at the right place<br>at the right time<br>can change history.<br>— Doug Coe</p>
<p>Seek common-ground,<br>and action will grow.</p>
<p>The world cares what you do.<br>But the Lord knows what your motives are.</p>
<p>We&#39;re blood.<br>We&#39;re family.<br>Through the highs,<br>and through the lows,<br>we&#39;re together.</p>
<p>Unity Salvation.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s an idea: Create a curriculum, follow it, and use that curriculum to create a university, an academy, an institute of knowledge. Seems like a lot of work, but many have done it before.</p>
<p>Neal Stephenson, an advisor at Blue Origin, and a science-fiction writer, says that it will be <em>very</em> difficult for the human-race to escape the solar-system. So, what does that mean? It means we&#39;re probably stuck here for awhile. However, we can definitely improve our quality of life and our lifestyles, while we&#39;re here in this solar-system. But how can we observably improve our lives?</p>
<p>Random question about climate change and climate science: Could we somehow leak the excess CO2 that&#39;s in the atmosphere into space? (Might be a dumb question.)</p>
